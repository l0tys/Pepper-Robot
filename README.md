# **Code for Pepper Robot**

Code for SoftBank Robotics humanoid robot Pepper using NAOqi SDK with Python 2.7.17

Since most if not all available software options are deprecated and/or are removed from the internet for Pepper 2.5 the only option is to use a community based version on GitHub of NAOqi SDK which only supports Python 2.7
